                            <p>In 2011, astronauts Brian Harper, Jocinda Fowler and newcomer Marcus are on a Space Shuttle mission to repair a satellite. Suddenly, a mysterious black swarm attacks the orbiter, killing Marcus and incapacitating Fowler before Harper can re-enter the shuttle. Although he is initially hailed as a hero for successfully returning the shuttle to Earth, Harper tries to tell his story, which is dismissed by NASA and, after an eighteen-month-long investigation, human error is blamed for the incident as Harper's account remains widely disbelieved. When Fowler fails to defend him during the hearing, Harper is fired.

                                Ten years later, conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman, who believes the Moon is an artificial megastructure, secretly uses time on a research telescope and discovers that the orbit of the Moon is veering closer to Earth. He attempts to share his findings with NASA but is unsuccessful in his efforts. He then turns to Harper, who dismisses him, leading Houseman to go public on social media. NASA independently discovers the anomaly and mounts a mission on an SLS Block 2 to investigate the abnormality. The same swarm that had attacked Harper's mission reappears, killing all three crew members after they drop a probe into a kilometers-deep artificial hole in the Moon.</p>
