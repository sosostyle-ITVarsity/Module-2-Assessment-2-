                            <h3>AMBULANCE</h3>
                            <p>War veteran Will Sharp, desperately in need of $231,000 for his wife Amy's surgery, reaches out to Danny, his adoptive brother and a life-long criminal, who talks him into taking part in a $32 million bank heist. Officer Zach, who goes to the bank to ask out a bank teller, is held hostage and accidentally shot by Will. The Special Investigation Section (SIS) of the LAPD arrives and shoots down the whole crew except Will and Danny. The brothers hijack an ambulance with EMT Cam Thompson on board, who is treating the injured Zach. Cam makes a desperate attempt to escape but decides to stay when Zach starts flatlining.

                                SIS Captain Monroe deploys helicopters to chase after the ambulance. Cam gets Danny to help her use a defibrillator and Will to transfer some of his blood to Zach. Danny calls Papi, one of his father's criminal friends, for help losing the police. When Cam stops Danny from shooting Zach's partner, Mark, who has been chasing them, Danny threatens to throw her off the ambulance. FBI Agent Anson Clark, a past friend of Danny's, is put on the case. Zach begins to bleed out; Cam, with Will's assistance, performs surgery despite her inexperience. Cam tries to convince Will to stop Danny. Monroe, unaware of the surgery's success, moves forward with the operation and prepares to snipe Will and Danny without negotiating for Cam's life. Clark calls Cam and tells her to get down. Cam, wanting to save Zach's life, alerts Will and Danny about the snipers. Danny threatens Cam again, causing Will and Danny to fight and later listen to music together to ease the tension.</p>
